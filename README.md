# whatsapp-bot

This project runs on node.js and uses a npm package called 'venom-bot' for interacting with WhatsApp.  
A user types certain commands and sends them to me on WhatsApp and venom-bot reads those commands and replies accordingly.  
Various other packages and APIs are also used.  
Some of the cool features of this bot are:

- Getting the details of movies, anime and songs and get lyrics too
- Playing text based games such as Truth or Dare, Would you rather etc.
- Search and view wikipedia content on WhatsApp
- Tag everyone | admin only tag everyone
- Correct grammar and translate sentences
- Create stickers
- Read text from Images
- Convert Images and gifs to stickers
- Create polls and vote
- Do mathematical calculations
- English Dictionary
