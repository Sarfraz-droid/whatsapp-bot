# whatsapp-bot  
  
This project runs on node.js and uses a npm package called 'venom-bot' for interacting with WhatsApp.  
A user types certain commands and sends them to me on WhatsApp and venom-bot reads those commands and replies accordingly.  
Some of the cool features of this bot are:  
- Getting the details of movies  
- Playing text based games such as Truth or Dare, Would you rather etc.  
- Search and view wikipedia content on WhatsApp
